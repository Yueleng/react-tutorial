# What is React.js

## React.js:

- A client-side JavaScript library.
- All about building modern, reactive user interfaces for the web.
- Declarative, component focused approach.

## Building Single-Page-Applications(SPAs)

- "Widget" approach on a multi-page-application. (Some) pages are still _rendered on and served by a backend server._
- (More common) React can also be used to _control the entire frontend_ of a web application. "Single-Page-Application" (SPA) approach. _Server only sends one HTML page_, thereafter, React takes over and controls the UI. **Notes: React may request extra information through ajax technology**.

## React.js alternatives

- React: Lean and focues component-based UI library. Certain features(e.g. routing) are added via community packages.
- Angular: Complete component-based UI framework, packed with features. Uses TypeScript. Can be overkill for smaller projects. (You don't need to rely on the community as much).
- Vue.js: Kind of the mixture of Angular and React. Complete component-based UI framework, includes most core features. It includes core freatures like routing, more features than react.js but less features than Angular.
