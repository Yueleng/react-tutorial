# Class Based Components

- What and Why
- Working with classes based components
- Error Boundaries

## Class-based components: An alternative to functions

- Functionial components are regular Javascript functions which return renderable results (typically JSX) (Modern Approach)
- Components can also be defined as JS classes where a `render()` method defines the to-be-rendered output. (Traditional Approach)
- Nowadarys, exception of error boundaries, there is no reason to go for class-based components
- Class-based components _Can not use_ React Hooks.
